Quick start ‚Äî run from release
1. Visit the releases page:
   https://github.com/amimasuka/student-management-system/releases
2. Download the release file for your OS. The release contains an executable or packaged app. Download the file and execute it.
3. The app opens a window. Use the menu to add students or import CSV.

Development setup (source version)
- Requirements: Python 3.8+.
- Tested with CPython on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Install steps
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/amimasuka/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
2. Create a venv and activate:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Core libs: tkinter (system), matplotlib, pandas, sqlalchemy
4. Launch:
   python run_app.py

App layout
- Dashboard
  - Overview cards with counts and averages.
  - Mini charts for quick insight.
- Students
  - Table view with pagination.
  - Add / Edit forms with validation.
- Attendance
  - Record sessions and mark status.
  - Filter by date and student.
- Analytics
  - Grade distribution histogram.
  - GPA trend line per cohort.
  - Export chart button.
- Settings
  - Backup / restore data.
  - Configure storage path.

Data model
- SQLite tables:
  - students (id, first_name, last_name, dob, program, enrollment_date, email, phone)
  - grades (id, student_id, course, term, grade, credits)
  - attendance (id, student_id, date, status)
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for data access.

CSV format
- Import: students CSV must have header row with these columns:
  id,first_name,last_name,dob,program,enrollment_date,email,phone
- Export: app writes the same format for portability.

Example usage ‚Äî CLI commands
- Launch UI:
  python run_app.py
- Run a data migration:
  python tools/migrate.py
- Export sample report:
  python tools/export_report.py --out report.pdf

Analytics examples
- GPA average per cohort
- Top 10 students by GPA
- Grade distribution by course
- Attendance heatmap by month

Extending the app
- Add new report types using pandas and matplotlib.
- Replace SQLite with a networked DB by swapping SQLAlchemy engine.
- Add authentication for multi-user environments.
- Swap UI theme or use a framework like PyQt for richer widgets.

Testing
- Unit tests for data layer live in tests/.
- Run tests:
  pytest -q

Common commands
- Lint:
  flake8 .
- Format:
  black .
- Run single test:
  pytest tests/test_models.py::test_student_create -q

Contributing
- Fork the repo and open a PR.
- Create a branch per feature or fix.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Add tests for new logic.
- Use clear commit messages.

Troubleshooting
- If the app fails to start, check Python and dependency versions.
- For UI errors, check Tkinter availability on the system. On some Linux systems install python3-tk.
- For DB issues, delete the local database file to reset data.

Security
- The app keeps data local by default.
- Validate CSV inputs before import to avoid malformed rows.
- Avoid running untrusted binaries. Prefer running the source in a venv if you audit code.
